                    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
                    <p>The design team designed the loyalty application in line with the business requirements. Both
                        functionalities and goals of the application were defined during workshops with business and
                        analysts team. The study was aimed at determining whether the designed paths are intuitive and
                        useful.</p>
                    <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                    <p>Find out whether the designed solutions are intuitive and clarify for users using loyalty
                        applications. The application included both: already existing functionalisties and solutions
                        that do not yet exist on the market.</p>

                    <li>Finding out if users achieve their goals in the application</li>
                    <li>Identifying places in the application that could make it difficult for users to achieve their

                    <li>Checking if the nomenclature used in the application is understandable</li>

                <h2>Research methods</h2>
                <p>I decided to conduct qualitative moderated usability tests. The tests were attended by a moderator
                    and an observer.</p>
                <h2>Research sample</h2>
                <p>The survey was conducted with 5 respondents. The respondents were users of loyalty mobile apps such
                    as: Żabka, Rossmann, Biedronka, Good lood, Lidl, Deckatlon, Mcdonalds, Orlen Vitay. The respondents
                    showed a very good command of English, one person is a Native Speaker.</p>

                <h2>Research flow</h2>
                <p>The study was divided into 3 parts due to the need to prepare prototypes (application before
                    development). The biggest problem during the research turned out to be defining how to divide the
                    prototypes so as not to limit the possibilities of actions in the application and thus not to
                    suggest the chosen path to the respondents.</p>
                <p>After determining the research problems, I planned a research scenario for each path and together
                    with the motion designer, we established the necessary prototypes.</p>
                <p>While creating prototypes, I started recruiting respondents. Due to the type of research material, I
                    decided to recruit respondents via social media using the Snowball sampling.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="right wide">
                <h2>After research</h2>
                <p>Thanks to the research, we were able to identify critical places on user paths and define potential
                    places that would allow users to make a mistake. We were also able to identify improvements to the
                    designed solutions and establish additional elements needed by users on their way to the goal.</p>
                <p>After the research, I prepared a report, which contained both a description of the research and
                    information about respondents - their habits and pain when using other loyalty applications. In
                    addition, the report includes both quantitative and qualitative data from usability tests and the
                    recommended solutions prepared on this basis.</p>
                <p>After sending the report, the whole team met at the workshop (Product Owner, Project Manager, Project
                    team and Researchers) to work out solutions together, prioritize subsequent changes and set up
                    further steps.</p>
